# How to provide an event that is raised on changing a grid layout


<p>This example demonstrates how to provide an event that is raised as soon as a grid layout is changed.</p>
<br />
<p>In this example, we have created a GridLayoutHelper class that handles changes of the GridControl object's necessary properties and columns, and raises a custom event in its handlers.</p>
<br />
<p>This class can be easily attached to the GridControl object in the following manner:</p>


```xaml
<dxg:GridControl x:Name="grid" AutoPopulateColumns="True">
	<dxmvvm:Interaction.Behaviors>
		<local:GridLayoutHelper LayoutChanged="OnGridLayoutChanged"/>
	</dxmvvm:Interaction.Behaviors>
</dxg:GridControl>
```
